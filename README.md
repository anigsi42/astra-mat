# AstraMat: AI-Powered Novel Material Discovery for Space

**Challenge**: Open Innovation

**Description**: AstraMat is an AI-native platform that designs novel regolith-based composites for Mars habitats, optimizing for low density (<1.5 g/cm³) and high radiation shielding (>60% for 5g/cm² protons) using inverse design. Built solo for NASA Space Apps 2025, it leverages RDKit and ML to generate and predict properties of bio-inspired, H-rich composites (e.g., regolith + polyethylene mimics), drawing on NASA’s lunar regolith data (NTRS.nasa.gov). Deployed on Vercel, it showcases how one person with AI can push materials science frontiers for space exploration.
